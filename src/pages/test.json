  "text": "\\n\\nExample of a Complete History and Physical Write-up \\n Patient Name: \\n Unit No: \\n Location: \\n \\nInformant: patient, who is reliable, and old CPMC chart. \\n \\nChief Complaint: This is the 3\\nrd\\n CPMC admission for this 83 year old woman with a long history of \\nhypertension who presented with the chief complaint of substernal “toothache like” chest pain of 12 hours \\nduration. \\n \\nHistory of Present Illness: Ms J. K. is an 83 year old retired nurse with a long history of hypertension that \\nwas previously well controlled on diuretic therapy. She was first admitted to CPMC in 1995 when she \\npresented with a complaint of intermittent midsternal chest pain. Her electrocardiogram at that time \\nshowed first degree atrioventricular block, and a chest X-ray showed mild pulmonary congestion, with \\ncardiomegaly. Myocardial infarction was ruled out by the lack of electrocardiographic and cardiac enzyme \\nabnormalities. Patient was discharged after a brief stay on a regimen of enalapril, and lasix, and digoxin, \\nfor presumed congestive heart failure. Since then she has been followed closely by her cardiologist. \\n \\nAside from hypertension and her postmenopausal state, the patient denies other coronary artery disease risk \\nfactors, such as diabetes, cigarette smoking, hypercholesterolemia or family history for heart disease. Since \\nher previous admission, she describes a stable two pillow orthopnea, dyspnea on exertion after walking two \\nblocks, and a mild chronic ankle edema which is worse on prolonged standing. She denies syncope, \\nparoxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or recent chest pains. \\n \\nShe was well until 11pm on the night prior to admission when she noted the onset of “aching pain under \\nher breast bone” while sitting, watching television. The pain was described as “heavy” and “toothache” \\nlike. It was not noted to radiate, nor increase with exertion. She denied nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, \\npalpitations, dizziness, or loss of consciousness. She took 2 tablespoon of antacid without relief, but did \\nmanage to fall sleep. In the morning she awoke free of pain, however upon walking to the bathroom, the \\npain returned with increased severity. At this time she called her daughter, who gave her an aspirin and \\nbrought her immediately to the emergency room. Her electrocardiogram on presentation showed sinus \\ntachycardia at 110, with marked ST elevation in leads I, AVL, V4-V6 and occasional ventricular \\nparoxysmal contractions. Patient immediately received thrombolytic therapy and cardiac medications, and \\nwas transferred to the intensive care unit. \\n \\nCurrent Regimen \\nDigoxin 0.125mg once daily \\nEnalapril 20mg twice daily \\nLasix 40mg once every other day \\nKcl 20mg once daily \\nTylenol 2 tabs twice daily as needed for arthritis \\n \\nPast Health \\nGeneral: Relatively good \\nInfectious Diseases: Usual childhood illnesses.

Her hematocrit was 24% on admission and she \\nreceived four units of packed cells. Colonoscopy revealed \\n multiple diverticuli. Since then her stool has been brown and \\n consistently hematest negative when checked in clinic. Several months after \\n this admission she was noted to be mildly jaundiced and had elevated liver \\n enzymes, at this time it was realized that she contracted hepatitis B from the \\n transfusions. Since then she has not had any evidence of chronic hepatitis. \\n7.GU: History of several episodes of cystitis, most recently E Coli 3/1/90, treated with \\nBactrim.
